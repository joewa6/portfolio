## What this post is actually about

This post is not about the specific domain used as an example.
It is about what can and cannot be inferred from finite trajectories
of a noisy dynamical system when decisions depend on that inference.

State explicitly what is *not* the point of the post.

---

## The Question

Clearly state the question being tested.

Avoid motivation.
Avoid history.
Avoid promises.

If the question cannot be answered falsifiably, stop.

---

## The System

Describe the system only insofar as it constrains inference.

Explain why this system is sufficient to expose the issue.
Do not add realism unless it is required.

---

## Models / Representations Compared

Enumerate the models, representations, or assumptions being compared.

For each:
- what information it uses
- what it ignores

No evaluation yet.

---

## What Works (Baseline Competence)

Show what all approaches get right.

This section builds trust.
Do not skip it.

---

## Where It Fails

Demonstrate divergence in at least one decision-relevant quantity.

Be concrete.
Use figures sparingly.

---

## Failure Mode Analysis

Explain *why* the failure occurs.

State clearly whether this is:
- a modelling limitation
- a data limitation
- an identifiability limit

If you cannot explain the failure, do not publish.

---

## Decision Consequences

Translate the failure into a real decision error.

Examples:
- incorrect ranking
- unstable rates
- false confidence
- wasted sampling

This is the point of the post.

---

## Reusable Rule

State one rule that generalises beyond this system.

One paragraph.
No hedging.

---

## Bridge to the Next Question

Explain what remains unresolved and why the next post exists.

Do not tease.
Do not hype.
Just constrain.

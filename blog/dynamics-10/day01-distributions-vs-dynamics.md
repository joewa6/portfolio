## What this post is actually about

This post is not about statistical mechanics.
It is about what can and cannot be inferred from finite trajectories
of a noisy dynamical system when decisions depend on that inference.

Fitting a distribution correctly does not guarantee correct dynamics.

---

## The Question

Does fitting the correct equilibrium distribution imply correct transition dynamics?

---

## The System

Describe the system only insofar as it constrains inference.

Explain why this system is sufficient to expose the issue.
Do not add realism unless it is required.

---

## Models / Representations Compared

Enumerate the models, representations, or assumptions being compared.

For each:
- what information it uses
- what it ignores

No evaluation yet.

---

## What Works (Baseline Competence)

Show what all approaches get right.

This section builds trust.
Do not skip it.

---

## Where It Fails

Demonstrate divergence in at least one decision-relevant quantity.

Be concrete.
Use figures sparingly.

---

## Failure Mode Analysis

Explain *why* the failure occurs.

State clearly whether this is:
- a modelling limitation
- a data limitation
- an identifiability limit

If you cannot explain the failure, do not publish.

---

## Decision Consequences

Translate the failure into a real decision error.

Examples:
- incorrect ranking
- unstable rates
- false confidence
- wasted sampling

This is the point of the post.

---

## Reusable Rule

State one rule that generalises beyond this system.

One paragraph.
No hedging.

---

## Bridge to the Next Question

Explain what remains unresolved and why the next post exists.

Do not tease.
Do not hype.
Just constrain.

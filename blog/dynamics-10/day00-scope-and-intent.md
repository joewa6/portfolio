## What this series is actually about

This series is not about any specific domain.
It is about what can and cannot be inferred from finite trajectories
of noisy dynamical systems when decisions depend on that inference.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- One question per post
- One reusable rule per post
- Explicit failure modes only
- Decision quantities stated upfront
- No motivation, no history, no hype
